# React Employee Directory




Welcome to my first React application! While simple, this does stand as an achievement for me as React was a bit difficult to grasp at first. This directory shows a list of employees and allows for sorting. This particular app does not make use of an API call. Rather, I personally seeded the information.

## Instructions
This app has little functionality. Presently, if you click the heading of the table, it will sort the seeded employees by age. Click again and it will sort in the opposite direction.
